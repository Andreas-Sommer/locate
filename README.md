This TYPO3 extension provides some functions to **assign a suitable language** version of your website to the website user or to 
**deny access to configurable pages** in configurable countries (HTTP status code 451).

The full documentation for the latest releases can be found [here](https://docs.typo3.org/p/leuchtfeuer/locate/master/en-us/).
